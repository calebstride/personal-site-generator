Feel free to look at the projects I've worked / am currently working on.

A lot of these pages are pretty short and don't go into much detail as it would take a lot of time to do, and it would probably be boring to read.

Some of the projects remain private on GitHub so not all of them will have the code available.

NOTE: A lot of these projects are done to help develope and practice my skills. I know a lot of the projects I've worked on already have solutions (probably better than mine) but I see this as good practice either way.
