## Summary

This page is about the initial version of ManageCabbage. It follows the processes and designing I went through from start to finish. Whilst hopefully picking out some interesting things I learnt along the way. Admittedly I am writing this a long time after creating the website so it will be on the briefer side.

## Introduction
The main goals of the webapp were to allow for spending to be logged and to show insights of the spending to the user.

To start I briefly designed how the website would function and the technologies needed to do so. Then I went on to design how the code would work and the objects etc. needed to run it.
