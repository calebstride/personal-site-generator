## Summary

This page is about the initial version of ManageCabbage. It follows the processes and designing I went through from start to finish. Whilst hopefully picking out some interesting things I learnt along the way. Admittedly I am writing this a long time after creating the website so it will be on the briefer side.

## Introduction
The main goals of the webapp were to allow for spending to be logged and to show insights of the spending to the user.

To start I briefly designed how the website would function and the technologies needed to do so. Then I went on to design how the code would work and the objects etc. needed to run it.

## Technologies
### Backend
At the time of starting this project the only programming language I knew how to use as a backend was php so that's what I went with.

I did a bit of googling for a php hosting platform (there are tonnes apparently) and ended up going with hostgator as it was reasonably low cost and provided what I needed.

The choice of the hosting platform meant I was stuck with mysql as a database. But luckily it was the one I'd worked with before when using php.

### Frontend
There isn't really much of a choice for frontend technologies for a website as it's mainly just html and JavaScript. 

I decided to not use any of the big JavaScript libraries (e.g. JQuery or Prototype) or different flavours of JavaScript (e.g. CoffeeScript, TypeScript). The reason being I wanted to try and learn the fundamentals and how it worked rather than just learning a specific way to use it. My final thought on this can be found [here](#javascript).

## Testing
Admittedly this is an area that I could have improved a lot on. I
