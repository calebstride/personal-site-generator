## Summary

Manage Cabbage is a personal spending management web application created by me (Caleb). It's main purpose is to record spending and to give insights into where money has been spent.

## Creation
### Why?
I've always liked to keep on top of my personal finances. Although finding an easy way to do so is hard. For a couple of years I used spreadsheets to keep track of all my spending. This was pretty messy and only really held basic information for transactions (how much and what day). So I decided to put my free time to good use and create a website to store and manage this data instead.

### How?
When I started designing and coding the website I didn't really have that much web experience and was freshly out of university. So I decided to start using what I currently knew a bit about, which was php. You can read about the first design [here](manageCabbage/manageCabbageOld.html).

After a while the website seemed like it was in need of an upgrade. It didn't help that the whole of the backend was written in php (a language I knew little about). So I decided to start looking at more up-to-date technologies and how I could better utilise my Java experience. You can read about that process here.


## FAQs

### Can I use it?
Not currently. Maybe in the future but at the moment I wouldn't be comfortable for other people to use it as I would be liable for their data.

### Why don't you just use one of the many existing applications?
Because this way I know my data is secure. Even though I'm pretty sure banks just sell your transaction info to third parties anyway.

### Will you integrate your website to pick up transactions externally?
It's been something I've thought about. It definitely makes sense to have it as an option so you don't have to manually enter each payment.

### What's with the name?
I was trying to think of a name for the website when buying a domain to host it. One of my friends suggested this and it just kind of stuck.
