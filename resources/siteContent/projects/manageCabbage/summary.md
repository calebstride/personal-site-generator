## Creation
### Why?
I've always liked to keep on top of my personal finances. Although finding an easy way to do so is hard. For a couple of years I used spreadsheets where I kept track of all my spending. This was pretty messy and only really held the most basic information (how much and what day) for transactions. So I decided to put my degree to good use and create a website to store and manage this data instead.
