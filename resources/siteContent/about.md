Hi, I'm Caleb Stride, a Computer Science graduate from Cardiff University.

This website is where I upload and talk about projects I'm working on, or just ideas that could become something later. 

I'm currently working as a Java software developer, so apologies in advance for any javascript you see.

Take a look around and if you have any business enquiries feel free to [contact me](contact.html).
